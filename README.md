# Farsi UI

A set of beautifully designed **RTL components** that you can customize, extend, and build on.

Start here, then make it your own.

**Open Source. Open Code. Persian.**

Farsi UI is the **Persian, RTL-first adaptation of shadcn/ui**. It follows the same philosophy, patterns, and simplicity — but is built from the ground up for **Farsi language and right-to-left interfaces**.

---

## What is Farsi UI?

Farsi UI is **not a registered component library** and not a packaged design system.

Just like shadcn/ui, it is:

* A **set of reusable component patterns**
* A **starting point**, not a black box
* Fully **customizable and extendable**
* Intended to be **copied into your project and owned by you**

You use Farsi UI to build **your own component library in Farsi**, adapted to your product, your brand, and your needs.

---

## Design Philosophy

* RTL is the default, not an afterthought
* Persian typography is treated as first-class
* Calm, modern, and production-ready design
* No visual noise, no unnecessary abstraction
* Same mental model as shadcn/ui

If you understand shadcn/ui, you already understand Farsi UI.

---

## What You Get

* RTL-native components (layout, spacing, interactions)
* shadcn-style component structure
* Radix-based accessibility patterns
* Tailwind CSS styling
* Clean, readable, modern UI suitable for real products

Everything is designed to feel **familiar**, **predictable**, and **easy to adapt**.

---

## What You Don’t Get

* No hidden registry
* No lock-in
* No forced theming system
* No opinionated branding
* No packaged CSS you can’t control

You own the code. Always.

---

## Who Is This For?

Farsi UI is for developers who:

* Build products in **Persian / Farsi**
* Need **proper RTL support**
* Like the shadcn/ui approach
* Want full control over their UI code
* Care about clean architecture and DX

---

## Technology Stack

* React + TypeScript
* Tailwind CSS
* Radix UI
* Same conventions and patterns as shadcn/ui

No custom runtime. No framework lock-in.

---

## How to Use

1. Start with Farsi UI components
2. Copy them into your project
3. Customize, rename, refactor
4. Extend them as your product grows

Farsi UI is a **foundation**, not a finished product.

---

## Inspiration

Farsi UI is inspired by **shadcn/ui**.

All credit for the original philosophy and approach belongs to the shadcn/ui project.

This project exists to bring the same experience to **Persian, RTL-first applications**.
